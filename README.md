To make life easier for the game designers that made the dialogues, i made a system that is flexible.  
I created a bunch of Scriptable Objects that can be connected to each others.   
Exemple : Dialogue 1 is connected to Dialogue 2 by answer 1.  
[scriptable]  

The whole dialogue system is revolved around picking the correct card    
depending on the mood of the dialogue and what the character is saying,  
there are 5 cards in the game : Silence(), ...

One that takes place in Winter and revolves around a   
kid that gets stereotyped by its gender portrayed by a little spirit.
